<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi, my name is Johannes, and I'm currently a second year PhD Student at the William Harvey Research Institute in London. My project is to investigate lymphocytes in the perioperative period. Besides immunology I'm super interested in data science and am trying to get more into machine learning at the moment. So this blog serves as my dumpsite for projects and articles. </p>
